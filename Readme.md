GrampsAIO package updating
==========================

**Gramps 4.2 and later.**

The Gramps "software bundle" for Windows or GrampsAIO is an all-in-one (a.k.a. "AIO") installation package of Gramps which includes all dependencies for the Windows platform.

This script helps to generate an upgraded Windows AIO package from an older Windows AIO package -- how to take one with an older Gramps and make one with a newer Gramps.

It is intended for Windows users and does not attempt to describe how to do the same thing on Linux or a Mac.

("AIO" means all-in-one, which means that everything you need to run Gramps is included in the one AIO file you download and then install -- all the related programs and library files which Gramps needs on Windows.) 

Any comments and help (e.g. on wiki pages) are welcome.
